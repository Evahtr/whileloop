# whileloop

A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. 
The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

The while construct consists of a block of code and a condition/expression.
The condition/expression is evaluated, and if the condition/expression is true, the code within the block is executed. 
This repeats until the condition/expression becomes false. 
Because the while loop checks the condition/expression before the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a pre-test loop. 
Compare this with the do while loop, which tests the condition/expression after the loop has executed.
